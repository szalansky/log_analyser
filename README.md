# Log analyser

## Installation

### Basic usage

This application only requires a Ruby interpreter. I wrote it using
Ruby 2.7.0 but I'm sure any 2.x Ruby will do.

To run simply execute:

`./analyser.rb --file=[PATH TO FILE WITH LOGS]`

### Tests and development

Run `bundle install` to install all project dependencies.

Tests are written in RSpec and can be run via `rspec` CLI.
